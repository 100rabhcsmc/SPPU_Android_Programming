**What is android**

Android is a software package and linux based operating system for mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones.
It is developed by Google and later the OHA (Open Handset Alliance). Java language is mainly used to write the android code even though other languages can be used.
The goal of android project is to create a successful real-world product that improves the mobile experience for end users.

**Features of Android**

The various features of Android are

**1. Application Framework**: It enables reuse and replacements of components
**2. Dalvik Virtual Machine**: It is optimized for mobile device.
**3. Integrated Browser**: It is based on open source web kit engine.
**4. Handset layouts**: Optimized Graphics: It is powered by a custom 2D graphics
Library 3D Graphics based on the OpenGL ES 1.0 Specification.
**5. Storage**: SQLite, a lightweight relational database.
**6. Media Support**: Android supports the following audio/video/still media formats:
H.263, H.264 (in 3GP or MP4 container), MPEG - 4 SP. AMR, AMR - WB (in 3GP

##Architecture of android
diagram will be in medium please refer:

The Android OS is roughly divided into five sections in four main layers:

**1.Linux kernel**: This is the kernel on which Android is based. This layer contains all
the low level device drivers for the various hardware components of an Android
device.
**2.Libraries**: These contain all the code that provides the main features of an
Android OS. For example, the SQLite library provides database support so that an
application can use it for data storage. The WebKit library provides functionalities for web browsing.
**3.Android runtime**: At the same layer as the libraries, the Android runtime
provides a set or core libraries that enable developers to write Android apps
using the Java programming language.
**4.Application framework**: Exposes the various capabilities of the Android os to
application developers so that they can make use or them in their applications.

**5.Applications**: At this top layer, you will find applications that ship with the
Android device (such as Phone, Contacts, Browser, etc.), as well as applications
that you download and install from the Android Market. Any applications that
you write are located at this laver
